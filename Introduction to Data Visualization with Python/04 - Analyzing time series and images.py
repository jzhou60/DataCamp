1. Multiple time series on common axes
For this exercise, you will construct a plot showing four time series stocks on the same axes. The time series in question are represented in the session using the identifiers aapl, ibm, csco, and msft. You'll generate a single plot showing all the time series on common axes with a legend.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Plot the aapl time series in blue with a label of 'AAPL'.
Plot the ibm time series in green with a label of 'IBM'.
Plot the csco time series in red with a label of 'CSCO'.
Plot the msft time series in magenta with a label of 'MSFT'.
Specify a rotation of 60 for the xticks with plt.xticks().
Add a legend in the 'upper left' corner of the plot.

2. Multiple time series slices (1)
You can easily slice subsets corresponding to different time intervals from a time series. In particular, you can use strings like '2001:2005', '2011-03:2011-12', or '2010-04-19:2010-04-30' to extract data from time intervals of length 5 years, 10 months, or 12 days respectively.

Unlike slicing from standard Python lists, tuples, and strings, when slicing time series by labels (and other pandas Series & DataFrames by labels), the slice includes the right-most portion of the slice. That is, extracting my_time_series['1990':'1995'] extracts data from my_time_series corresponding to 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 inclusive.
You can use partial strings or datetime objects for indexing and slicing from time series.
For this exercise, you will use time series slicing to plot the time series aapl over its full 11-year range and also over a shorter 2-year range. You'll arrange these plots in a 2Ã—1 grid of subplots

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Plot the series aapl in 'blue' in the top subplot of a vertically-stacked pair of subplots, with the xticks rotated to 45 degrees.
Extract a slice named view from the series aapl containing data from the years 2007 to 2008 (inclusive). This has been done for you.
Plot the slice view in black in the bottom subplot.

plt.show()


'''
3. Multiple time series slices (2)
In this exercise, you will use the same time series aapl from the previous exercise and plot tighter views of the data.

Partial string indexing works without slicing as well. For instance, using my_time_series['1995'], my_time_series['1999-05'], and my_time_series['2000-11-04'] respectively extracts views of the time series my_time_series corresponding to the entire year 1995, the entire month May 1999, and the entire day November 4, 2000.

Reassign the slice view to contain data from the series aapl for January 2008. This has been done for you.
Plot the slice view in 'green' in the bottom subplot with the xticks rotated to 45 degrees.

4. Plotting an inset view
Remember, rather than comparing plots with subplots or overlayed plots, you can generate an inset view directly using plt.axes(). In this exercise, you'll reproduce two of the time series plots from the preceding two exercises. Your figure will contain an inset plot to highlight the dramatic changes in AAPL stock price between November 2007 and April 2008 (as compared to the 11 years from 2001 to 2011).

5. Plotting moving averages
In this exercise, you will plot pre-computed moving averages of AAPL stock prices in distinct subplots.

The time series aapl is overlayed in black in each subplot for comparison.
The time series mean_30, mean_75, mean_125, and mean_250 have been computed for you (containing the windowed averages of the series aapl computed over windows of width 30 days, 75 days, 125 days, and 250 days respectively).

6. Plotting moving standard deviations
Having plotted pre-computed moving averages of AAPL stock prices on distinct subplots in the previous exercise, you will now plot pre-computed moving standard deviations of the same stock prices, this time together on common axes.

The time series aapl is not plotted in this case; it is of a different length scale than the standard deviations.
The time series std_30, std_75, stdn_125, & std_250 have been computed for you (containing the windowed standard deviations of the series aapl computed over windows of width 30 days, 75 days, 125 days, & 250 days respectively).

7. Extracting a histogram from a grayscale image
For grayscale images, various image processing algorithms use an image histogram. Recall that an image is a two-dimensional array of numerical intensities. An image histogram, then, is computed by counting the occurences of distinct pixel intensities over all the pixels in the image.

For this exercise, you will load an unequalized low contrast image of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand (originally by Phillip Capper, modified by User:Konstable, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0). You will plot the image and use the pixel intensity values to plot a normalized histogram of pixel intensities.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Load data from the file '640px-Unequalized_Hawkes_Bay_NZ.jpg' into an array.
Display image with a color map of 'gray' in the top subplot.
Flatten image into a 1-D array using the .flatten() method.
Display a histogram of pixels in the bottom subplot.
Use histogram options bins=64, range=(0,256), and normed=True to control numerical binning and the vertical scale.
Use plotting options color='red' and alpha=0.4 to tailor the color and transparency.

'''

# Load the image into an array: image
image = plt.imread('640px-Unequalized_Hawkes_Bay_NZ.jpg')

# Display image in top subplot using color map 'gray'
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
plt.title('Original image')
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')

# Flatten the image into 1 dimension: pixels
pixels = image.flatten()

# Display a histogram of the pixels in the bottom subplot
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
plt.xlim((0,255))
plt.title('Normalized histogram')
plt.hist(pixels, bins=64, color='red', alpha=0.4, range=(0, 256), normed=True)

'''
8. Cumulative Distribution Function from an image histogram
A histogram of a continuous random variable is sometimes called a Probability Distribution Function (or PDF). The area under a PDF (a definite integral) is called a Cumulative Distribution Function (or CDF). The CDF quantifies the probability of observing certain pixel intensities.

Your task here is to plot the PDF and CDF of pixel intensities from a grayscale image. You will use the grayscale image of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand (originally by Phillip Capper, modified by User:Konstable, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0). This time, the 2D array image will be pre-loaded and pre-flattened into the 1D array pixels for you.

The histogram option cumulative=True permits viewing the CDF instead of the PDF.
Notice that plt.grid('off') switches off distracting grid lines.
The command plt.twinx() allows two plots to be overlayed sharing the x-axis but with different scales on the y-axis.
INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
First, use plt.hist() to plot the histogram of the 1-D array pixels in the bottom subplot.
Use the histogram options bins=64, range=(0,256), and normed=False.
Use the plotting options alpha=0.4 and color='red' to make the overlayed plots easier to see.
Second, use plt.twinx() to overlay plots with different vertical scales on a common horizontal axis.
Third, call plt.hist() again to overlay the CDF in the bottom subplot.
Use the histogram options bins=64, range=(0,256), and normed=True.
This time, also use cumulative=True to compute and display the CDF.
Also, use alpha=0.4 and color='blue' to make the overlayed plots easier to see.
'''

# Load the image into an array: image
image = plt.imread('640px-Unequalized_Hawkes_Bay_NZ.jpg')

# Display image in top subplot using color map 'gray'
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original image')
plt.axis('off')

# Flatten the image into 1 dimension: pixels
pixels = image.flatten()

# Display a histogram of the pixels in the bottom subplot
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
pdf = plt.hist(pixels, bins=64, range=(0,256), normed=False,
               color='red', alpha=0.4)
plt.grid('off')

plt.twinx()

# Display a cumulative histogram of the pixels
cdf = plt.hist(pixels, bins=64, range=(0,256),
               cumulative=True, normed=True,
               color='blue', alpha=0.4)

9. Equalizing an image histogram
Histogram equalization is an image processing procedure that reassigns image pixel intensities. The basic idea is to use interpolation to map the original CDF of pixel intensities to a CDF that is almost a straight line. In essence, the pixel intensities are spread out and this has the practical effect of making a sharper, contrast-enhanced image. This is particularly useful in astronomy and medical imaging to help us see more features.

For this exercise, you will again work with the grayscale image of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand (originally by Phillip Capper, modified by User:Konstable, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0). Notice the sample code produces the same plot as the previous exercise. Your task is to modify the code from the previous exercise to plot the new equalized image as well as its PDF and CDF.

The arrays image and pixels are extracted for you in advance.
The CDF of the original image is computed using plt.hist().
Notice an array new_pixels is created for you that interpolates new pixel values using the original image CDF.
INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use the NumPy array method .reshape() to create a 2-D array new_image from the 1-D array new_pixels. The resulting new_image should have the same shape as image.shape.
Display new_image with a 'gray' color map to display the sharper, equalized image.
Plot the PDF of new_pixels in 'red'.
Use plt.twinx() to overlay plots with different vertical scales on a common horizontal axis.
Plot the CDF of new_pixels in 'blue'.
