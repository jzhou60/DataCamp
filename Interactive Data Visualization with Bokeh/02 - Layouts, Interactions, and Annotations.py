1. Creating rows of plots
Layouts are collections of Bokeh figure objects.

In this exercise, you're going to create two plots from the Literacy and Birth Rate data set to plot fertility vs female literacy and population vs female literacy.

By using the row() method, you'll create a single layout of the two figures.

Remember, as in the previous chapter, once you have created your figures, you can interact with them in various ways.

In this exercise, you may have to scroll sideways to view both figures in the row layout. Alternatively, you can view the figures in a new window by clicking on the expand icon to the right of the "Bokeh plot" tab.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import row from the bokeh.layouts module.
Create a new figure p1 using the figure() function and specifying the two parameters x_axis_label and y_axis_label.
Add a circle glyph to p1. The x-axis data is fertility and y-axis data is female_literacy. Be sure to also specify source=source.
Create a new figure p2 using the figure() function and specifying the two parameters x_axis_label and y_axis_label.
Add a circle() glyph to p2, specifying the x and y parameters.
Put p1 and p2 into a horizontal layout using row().
Click 'Submit Answer' to output the file and show the figure.

# Import row from bokeh.layouts
from bokeh.layouts import row

# Create the first figure: p1
p1 = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a circle glyph to p1
p1.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Create the second figure: p2
p2 = figure(x_axis_label='population', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a circle glyph to p2
p2.circle('population', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Put p1 and p2 into a horizontal row: layout
layout = row(p1, p2)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_row.html')
show(layout)

'''
2. Creating columns of plots
In this exercise, you're going to use the column() function to create a single column layout of the two plots you created in the previous exercise.

Figure p1 has been created for you.

In this exercise and the ones to follow, you may have to scroll down to view the lower portion of the figure.

# Add circle scatter to the figure p1
p1.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Create a new blank figure: p2
p2 = figure(x_axis_label='population', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add circle scatter to the figure p2
p2.circle('population', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Put plots p1 and p2 in a column: layout
layout = column(p1,p2)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_column.html')
show(layout)

'''
3. Nesting rows and columns of plots
You can create nested layouts of plots by combining row and column layouts.

In this exercise, you'll make a 3-plot layout in two rows using the auto-mpg data set.

Three plots have been created for you of average mpg vs year, mpg vs hp, and mpg vs weight.

Your job is to use the column() and row() functions to make a two-row layout where the first row will have only the average mpg vs year plot and the second row will have mpg vs hp and mpg vs weight plots as columns.

By using the sizing_mode argument, you can scale the widths to fill the whole figure.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import row and column from bokeh.layouts.
Create a column layout called row2 with the figures mpg_hp and mpg_weight in a list and set sizing_mode='scale_width'.
Create a row layout called layout with the figure avg_mpg and the column layout row2 in a list and set sizing_mode='scale_width'.
'''

# Import column and row from bokeh.layouts
from bokeh.layouts import column, row

# Make a column layout that will be used as the second row: row2
row2 = column([mpg_hp, mpg_weight], sizing_mode='scale_width')

# Make a row layout that includes the above column layout: layout
layout = row([avg_mpg, row2], sizing_mode='scale_width')

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('layout_custom.html')
show(layout)

'''
4. Creating gridded layouts
Regular grids of Bokeh plots can be generated with gridplot.

In this example, you're going to display four plots of fertility vs female literacy for four regions: Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe.

Your job is to create a list-of-lists for the four Bokeh plots that have been provided to you as p1, p2, p3 and p4. The list-of-lists defines the row and column placement of each plot.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import gridplot from the bokeh.layouts module.
Create a list called row1 containing plots p1 and p2.
Create a list called row2 containing plots p3 and p4.
Create a gridplot using row1 and row2. You will have to pass in row1 and row2 in the form of a list.
'''

# Import gridplot from bokeh.layouts
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot

# Create a list containing plots p1 and p2: row1
row1 = [p1,p2]

# Create a list containing plots p3 and p4: row2
row2 = [p3,p4]

# Create a gridplot using row1 and row2: layout
layout = gridplot([row1,row2])

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('grid.html')
show(layout)

'''
5. Starting tabbed layouts
Tabbed layouts can be created in Bokeh by placing plots or layouts in Panels.

In this exercise, you'll take the four fertility vs female literacy plots from the last exercise and make a Panel() for each.

No figure will be generated in this exercise. Instead, you will use these panels in the next exercise to build and display a tabbed layout.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import Panel from bokeh.models.widgets.
Create a new panel tab1 with child p1 and a title of 'Latin America'.
Create a new panel tab2 with child p2 and a title of 'Africa'.
Create a new panel tab3 with child p3 and a title of 'Asia'.
Create a new panel tab4 with child p4 and a title of 'Europe'.
Click submit to check your work.
'''

# Import Panel from bokeh.models.widgets
from bokeh.models.widgets import Panel

# Create tab1 from plot p1: tab1
tab1 = Panel(child=p1, title='Latin America')

# Create tab2 from plot p2: tab2
tab2 = Panel(child=p2, title='Africa')

# Create tab3 from plot p3: tab3
tab3 = Panel(child=p3, title='Asia')

# Create tab4 from plot p4: tab4
tab4 = Panel(child=p4, title='Europe')

'''
6. Displaying tabbed layouts
Tabbed layouts are collections of Panel objects. Using the figures and Panels from the previous two exercises, you'll create a tabbed layout to change the region in the fertility vs female literacy plots.

Your job is to create the layout using Tabs() and assign the tabs keyword argument to your list of Panels. The Panels have been created for you as tab1, tab2, tab3 and tab4.

After you've displayed the figure, explore the tabs you just added! The "Pan", "Box Zoom" and "Wheel Zoom" tools are also all available as before.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import Tabs from bokeh.models.widgets.
Create a Tabs layout called layout with tab1, tab2, tab3, and tab4.

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('tabs.html')
show(layout)

'''
7. Linked axes
Linking axes between plots is achieved by sharing range objects.

In this exercise, you'll link four plots of female literacy vs fertility so that when one plot is zoomed or dragged, one or more of the other plots will respond.

The four plots p1, p2, p3 and p4 along with the layout that you created in the last section have been provided for you.

Your job is link p1 with the three other plots by assignment of the .x_range and .y_range attributes.

After you have linked the axes, explore the plots by clicking and dragging along the x or y axes of any of the plots, and notice how the linked plots change together.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Link the x_range of p2 to p1.
Link the y_range of p2 to p1.
Link the x_range of p3 to p1.
Link the y_range of p4 to p1.

'''

# Link the x_range of p2 to p1: p2.x_range
p2.x_range = p1.x_range

# Link the y_range of p2 to p1: p2.y_range
p2.y_range = p1.y_range

# Link the x_range of p3 to p1: p3.x_range
p3.x_range = p1.x_range

# Link the y_range of p4 to p1: p4.y_range
p4.y_range = p1.y_range

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('linked_range.html')
show(layout)

'''
8. Linked brushing
By sharing the same ColumnDataSource object between multiple plots, selection tools like BoxSelect and LassoSelect will highlight points in both plots that share a row in the ColumnDataSource.

In this exercise, you'll plot female literacy vs fertility and population vs fertility in two plots using the same ColumnDataSource.

After you have built the figure, experiment with the Lasso Select and Box Select tools. Use your mouse to drag a box or lasso around points in one figure, and notice how points in the other figure that share a row in the ColumnDataSource also get highlighted.

Before experimenting with the Lasso Select, however, click the Bokeh plot pop-out icon to pop out the figure so that you can definitely see everything that you're doing.

Create a ColumnDataSource object called source from the data DataFrame.
Create a new figure p1 using the figure() function. In addition to specifying the parameters x_axis_label and y_axis_label, you will also have to specify the BoxSelect and LassoSelect selection tools with tools='box_select,lasso_select'.
Add a circle glyph to p1. The x-axis data is fertility and y-axis data is female literacy. Be sure to also specify source=source.
Create a second figure p2 similar to how you created p1.
Add a circle glyph to p2. The x-axis data is fertility and y-axis data is population. Be sure to also specify source=source.
Create a row layout of figures p1 and p2.
'''

# Create ColumnDataSource: source
source = ColumnDataSource(data)

# Create the first figure: p1
p1 = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female literacy (% population)',
            tools='box_select,lasso_select')

# Add a circle glyph to p1
p1.circle('fertility', 'female literacy', source=source)

# Create the second figure: p2
p2 = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='population (millions)',
            tools='box_select,lasso_select')

# Add a circle glyph to p2
p2.circle('fertility', 'population', source=source)

# Create row layout of figures p1 and p2: layout
layout = row(p1,p2)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('linked_brush.html')
show(layout)

'''
9. How to create legends
Legends can be added to any glyph by using the legend keyword argument.

In this exercise, you will plot two circle glyphs for female literacy vs fertility in Africa and Latin America.

Two ColumnDataSources called latin_america and africa have been provided.

Your job is to plot two circle glyphs for these two objects with fertility on the x axis and female_literacy on the y axis and add the legend values. The figure p has been provided for you.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Add a red circle glyph to the figure p using the latin_america ColumnDataSource. Specify a size of 10 and legend of Latin America.
Add a blue circle glyph to the figure p using the africa ColumnDataSource. Specify a size of 10 and legend of Africa.
'''

# Add the first circle glyph to the figure p
p.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=latin_america, size=10, color='red', legend='Latin America')

# Add the second circle glyph to the figure p
p.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=africa, size=10, color='blue', legend='Africa')

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_lit_groups.html')
show(p)

'''
10. Positioning and styling legends
Properties of the legend can be changed by using the legend member attribute of a Bokeh figure after the glyphs have been plotted.

In this exercise, you'll adjust the background color and legend location of the female literacy vs fertility plot from the previous exercise.

The figure object p has been created for you along with the circle glyphs.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use p.legend.location to adjust the legend location to be on the 'bottom_left'.
Use p.legend.background_fill_color to set the background color of the legend to 'lightgray'.
'''

# Assign the legend to the bottom left: p.legend.location
p.legend.location='bottom_left'

# Fill the legend background with the color 'lightgray': p.legend.background_fill_color
p.legend.background_fill_color='lightgray'

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_lit_groups.html')
show(p)

'''
11. Adding a hover tooltip
Working with the HoverTool is easy for data stored in a ColumnDataSource.

In this exercise, you will create a HoverTool object and display the country for each circle glyph in the figure that you created in the last exercise. This is done by assigning the tooltips keyword argument to a list-of-tuples specifying the label and the column of values from the ColumnDataSource using the @ operator.

The figure object has been prepared for you as p.

After you have added the hover tooltip to the figure, be sure to interact with it by hovering your mouse over each point to see which country it represents.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import the HoverTool class from bokeh.models.
Use the HoverTool() function to create a HoverTool object called hover and set the tooltips argument to be [('Country','@Country')].
Use p.add_tools() with your HoverTool object to add it to the figure.
'''

# Import HoverTool from bokeh.models
from bokeh.models import HoverTool

# Create a HoverTool object: hover
hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[('Country','@Country')])

# Add the HoverTool object to figure p
p.add_tools(hover)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('hover.html')
show(p)
