1. EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches
For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.

In the next few problems, you will look at the beak depth of G. scandens on Daphne Major in 1975 and in 2012. To start with, let's plot all of the beak depth measurements in 1975 and 2012 in a bee swarm plot.

The data are stored in a pandas DataFrame called df with columns 'year' and 'beak_depth'. The units of beak depth are millimeters (mm).

2. ECDFs of beak depths
While bee swarm plots are useful, we found that ECDFs are often even better when doing EDA. Plot the ECDFs for the 1975 and 2012 beak depth measurements on the same plot.

For your convenience, the beak depths for the respective years has been stored in the NumPy arrays bd_1975 and bd_2012.

3. Parameter estimates of beak depths
Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.

Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.

Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 1975 beak depths using your draw_bs_reps() function. Also get 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 2012 beak depths.
Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference of means.

4. Hypothesis test: Are beaks deeper in 2012?
Your plot of the ECDF and determination of the confidence interval make it pretty clear that the beaks of G. scandens on Daphne Major have gotten deeper. But is it possible that this effect is just due to random chance? In other words, what is the probability that we would get the observed difference in mean beak depth if the means were the same?

Be careful! The hypothesis we are testing is not that the beak depths come from the same distribution. For that we could use a permutation test. The hypothesis is that the means are equal. To perform this hypothesis test, we need to shift the two data sets so that they have the same mean and then use bootstrap sampling to compute the difference of means.

8. Beak length to depth ratio
The linear regressions showed interesting information about the beak geometry. The slope was the same in 1975 and 2012, suggesting that for every millimeter gained in beak length, the birds gained about half a millimeter in depth in both years. However, if we are interested in the shape of the beak, we want to compare the ratio of beak length to beak depth. Let's make that comparison.

10. Correlation of offspring and parental data
In an effort to quantify the correlation between offspring and parent beak depths, we would like to compute statistics, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, between parents and offspring. To get confidence intervals on this, we need to do a pairs bootstrap.

You have already written a function to do pairs bootstrap to get estimates for parameters derived from linear regression. Your task in this exercise is to modify that function to make a new function with call signature draw_bs_pairs(x, y, func, size=1) that performs pairs bootstrap and computes a single statistic on the pairs samples defined by func(bs_x, bs_y). In the next exercise, you will use pearson_r for func.

Things to keep in mind: The modified function requires an additional func parameter and returns only bs_replicates, as opposed to bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps as the function in the sample code does.

12. Measuring heritability
Remember that the Pearson correlation coefficient is the ratio of the covariance to the geometric mean of the variances of the two data sets. This is a measure of the correlation between parents and offspring, but might not be the best estimate of heritability. If we stop and think, it makes more sense to define heritability as the ratio of the covariance between parent and offspring to the variance of the parents alone. In this exercise, you will estimate the heritability and perform a pairs bootstrap calculation to get the 95% confidence interval.

This exercise highlights a very important point. Statistical inference (and data analysis in general) is not a plug-n-chug enterprise. You need to think carefully about the questions you are seeking to answer with your data and analyze them appropriately. If you are interested in how heritable traits are, the quantity we defined as the heritability is more apt than the off-the-shelf statistic, the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Remember, the data are stored in bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens, bd_parent_fortis, and bd_offspring_fortis.
