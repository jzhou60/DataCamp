1. Generating random numbers using the np.random module
We will be hammering the np.random module for the rest of this course and its sequel. Actually, you will probably call functions from this module more than any other while wearing your hacker statistician hat. Let's start by taking its simplest function, np.random.random() for a test spin. The function returns a random number between zero and one. Call np.random.random() a few times in the IPython shell. You should see numbers jumping around between zero and one.

In this exercise, we'll generate lots of random numbers between zero and one, and then plot a histogram of the results. If the numbers are truly random, all bars in the histogram should be of (close to) equal height.

You may have noticed that, in the video, Justin generated 4 random numbers by passing the keyword argument size=4 to np.random.random(). Such an approach is more efficient than a for loop: in this exercise, however, you will write a for loop to experience hacker statistics as the practice of repeating an experiment over and over again.

Seed the random number generator using the seed 42.
Initialize an empty array, random_numbers, of 100,000 entries to store the random numbers. Make sure you use np.empty(100000) to do this.
Write a for loop to draw 100,000 random numbers using np.random.random(), storing them in the random_numbers array. To do so, loop over range(100000).
Plot a histogram of random_numbers. It is not necessary to label the axes in this case because we are just checking the random number generator. Hit 'Submit Answer' to show your plot.

2. The np.random module and Bernoulli trials
You can think of a Bernoulli trial as a flip of a possibly biased coin. Specifically, each coin flip has a probability p of landing heads (success) and probability 1âˆ’p of landing tails (failure). In this exercise, you will write a function to perform n Bernoulli trials, perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p), which returns the number of successes out of n Bernoulli trials, each of which has probability p of success. To perform each Bernoulli trial, use the np.random.random() function, which returns a random number between zero and one.

Define a function with signature perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p).
Initialize to zero a variable n_success the counter of Trues, which are Bernoulli trial successes.
Write a for loop where you perform a Bernoulli trial in each iteration and increment the number of success if the result is True. Perform n iterations by looping over range(n).
To perform a Bernoulli trial, choose a random number between zero and one using np.random.random(). If the number you chose is less than p, increment n_success (use the += 1 operator to achieve this).
The function returns the number of successes n_success.

def perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p):
    """Perform n Bernoulli trials with success probability p
    and return number of successes."""

    n_success = 0


    # Perform trials
    for i in range(n):
        # Choose random number between zero and one: random_number
        random_number = np.random.random()

        # If less than p, it's a success so add one to n_success
        if random_number < p:
            n_success += 1

    return n_success

print(perform_bernoulli_trials(10000,0.65))

3. How many defaults might we expect?
Let's say a bank made 100 mortgage loans. It is possible that anywhere between 0 and 100 of the loans will be defaulted upon. You would like to know the probability of getting a given number of defaults, given that the probability of a default is p = 0.05. To investigate this, you will do a simulation. You will perform 100 Bernoulli trials using the perform_bernoulli_trials() function you wrote in the previous exercise and record how many defaults we get. Here, a success is a default. (Remember that the word "success" just means that the Bernoulli trial evaluates to True, i.e., did the loan recipient default?) You will do this for another 100 Bernoulli trials. And again and again until we have tried it 1000 times. Then, you will plot a histogram describing the probability of the number of defaults.

Seed the random number generator to 42.
Initialize n_defaults, an empty array, using np.empty(). It should contain 1000 entries, since we are doing 1000 simulations.
Write a for loop with 1000 iterations to compute the number of defaults per 100 loans using the perform_bernoulli_trials() function. It accepts two arguments: the number of trials n - in this case 100 - and the probability of success p - in this case the probability of a default, which is 0.05. On each iteration of the loop store the result in an entry of n_defaults.
Plot a histogram of n_defaults. Include the normed=True keyword argument so that the height of the bars of the histogram indicate the probability.
Show your plot.

    n_defaults[i] = perform_bernoulli_trials(100,0.05)

4. Will the bank fail?
Plot the number of defaults you got from the previous exercise, in your namespace as n_defaults, as a CDF. The ecdf() function you wrote in the first chapter is available.

If interest rates are such that the bank will lose money if 10 or more of its loans are defaulted upon, what is the probability that the bank will lose money?

Compute the x and y values for the ECDF of n_defaults.
Plot the ECDF, making sure to label the axes. Remember to include marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x and y in your call plt.plot().
Show the plot.
Compute the total number of entries in your n_defaults array that were greater than or equal to 10. To do so, compute a boolean array that tells you whether a given entry of n_defaults is >= 10. Then sum all the entries in this array using np.sum(). For example, np.sum(n_defaults <= 5) would compute the number of defaults with 5 or fewer defaults.
The probability that the bank loses money is the fraction of n_defaults that are greater than or equal to 10. Print this result by hitting 'Submit Answer'!

n_lose_money = np.sum(n_defaults >= 10)

# Compute and print probability of losing money
print('Probability of losing money =', n_lose_money / len(n_defaults))

5. Sampling out of the Binomial distribution
Compute the probability mass function for the number of defaults we would expect for 100 loans as in the last section, but instead of simulating all of the Bernoulli trials, perform the sampling using np.random.binomial(). This is identical to the calculation you did in the last set of exercises using your custom-written perform_bernoulli_trials() function, but far more computationally efficient. Given this extra efficiency, we will take 10,000 samples instead of 1000. After taking the samples, plot the CDF as last time. This CDF that you are plotting is that of the Binomial distribution.

Note: For this exercise and all going forward, the random number generator is pre-seeded for you (with np.random.seed(42)) to save you typing that each time.

6. Plotting the Binomial PMF
As mentioned in the video, plotting a nice looking PMF requires a bit of matplotlib trickery that we will not go into here. Instead, we will plot the PMF of the Binomial distribution as a histogram with skills you have already learned. The trick is setting up the edges of the bins to pass to plt.hist() via the bins keyword argument. We want the bins centered on the integers. So, the edges of the bins should be -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... up to max(n_defaults) + 1.5. You can generate an array like this using np.arange() and then subtracting 0.5 from the array.

You have already sampled out of the Binomial distribution during your exercises on loan defaults, and the resulting samples are in the NumPy array n_defaults.

INSTRUCTIONS

Using np.arange(), compute the bin edges such that the bins are centered on the integers. Store the resulting array in the variable bins.
Use plt.hist() to plot the histogram of n_defaults with the normed=True and bins=bins keyword arguments.

# Compute bin edges: bins
bins = np.arange(min(n_defaults), max(n_defaults) + 1.5) - 0.5

7. Relationship between Binomial and Poisson distributions
You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to np approximates a Binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success (with n large and p small). Importantly, the Poisson distribution is often simpler to work with because it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution.

Let's explore these two distributions computationally. You will compute the mean and standard deviation of samples from a Poisson distribution with an arrival rate of 10. Then, you will compute the mean and standard deviation of samples from a Binomial distribution with parameters n and p such that np=10.

Using np.random.binomial() inside the provided for loop, draw 10000 samples from a Binomial distribution with each n, p pair and print the mean and standard deviation of the samples. There are 3 n, p pairs: 20, 0.5, 100, 0.1, and 1000, 0.01. These can be accessed inside the loop as n[i], p[i].
